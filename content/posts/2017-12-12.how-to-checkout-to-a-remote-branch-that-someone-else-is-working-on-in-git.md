First, fetch all branches from remote:

```bash
$ git fetch --all
```

Say you want to checkout to ```production``` from the remote.

```bash
$ git checkout --track origin/production
# Branch production set up to track remote branch production from origin.
# Switched to a new branch 'production'
```

> (```--track``` is shorthand for ```git checkout -b [branch] [remotename]/[branch]```)

This will give you a local copy of the branch ```production```, and any update that has been pushed will also show up remotely
